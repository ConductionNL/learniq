/**
 * Which structure the app shows: the simple one or the full one.
 *
 * Learniq builds two shapes of itself from one manifest. `simple` is the
 * default: at most ten menu entries for each role, under three captions.
 * `full` is the navigation as it was before the profile existed. An
 * administrator picks one on the admin settings page, and the page controller
 * hands the choice to the frontend as initial state.
 *
 * Nothing is removed in either. Both are built from the same manifest, so
 * every page keeps its route and every deep link keeps working.
 *
 * The frontend half is `src/utils/structureProfile.js`, and
 * `MenuStructureTest` fails when the two spell the key or the words
 * differently.
