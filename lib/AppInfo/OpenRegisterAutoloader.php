/**
 * Registers OpenRegister's autoload prefix before AppHost is referenced.
 *
 * ## Why this is needed (ADR-040)
 *
 * `OC_App::getEnabledApps()` does `sort($apps)`, and
 * `Coordinator::registerApps()` walks THAT sorted list registering each
 * app's autoloader and then calling `$app->register()` for
 * one app at a time. So every app's `register()` runs BEFORE the PSR-4 prefix
 * of every alphabetically-LATER app exists.
 *
 * This app's former id, `scholiq`, sorted AFTER `openregister`, so the prefix
 * happened to be on the autoloader by the time this app registered — an
 * accident of the alphabet, not a design property. The 2026 rename to
 * `learniq` is exactly the scenario that accident could not survive: `learniq`
 * sorts BEFORE `openregister`, so without this class the PSR-4 prefix would
 * NOT yet be on the autoloader when this app registers. `Bootstrap::register()`
 * is called UNGUARDED, so the resulting `\Error` would abort the WHOLE of
 * `Application::register()`. `Coordinator::registerApps()` catches it, logs an
 * `emergency` and continues, so Learniq would stay enabled and keep serving
 * with every registration below that line silently missing.
 *
 * Registering the prefix ourselves removes the dependency on ordering
 * entirely. The registration is idempotent, so on the current ordering this
 * call is free.
 *
 * Lives in its own class rather than inline in `Application::register()` for
 * one reason: `Application` cannot be constructed without a Nextcloud DI
 * container, so an inline prelude is unreachable from a unit test. Here the
 * degraded-path contract — "this NEVER throws, whatever the instance looks
 * like" — is directly assertable, and it is asserted.

	 * MUST be called before any `OCA\OpenRegister\…` reference in
	 * `Application::register()`, including a `class_exists()` probe — the probe
	 * answers FALSE, not "not yet loaded", and a FALSE is indistinguishable
	 * from OpenRegister being absent.
	 *
	 * ## Public API only (Nextcloud 35)
	 *
	 * This used to call `\OC_App::registerAutoloading()`. That is private API
	 * and Nextcloud 35 REMOVED it (it moved to the equally private
	 * `OC\App\AppManager::registerAutoloading()`), so the `\Error` landed in the
	 * catch below and the prefix was never registered. For an app shipping
	 * `vendor/autoload.php` — which OpenRegister does — Nextcloud's own
	 * registration reduces to a PSR-4 prefix over `lib/`, so that is exactly
	 * what is registered here, with `spl_autoload_register()` and the public
	 * `IAppManager`. Same approach as keepiq#712.
	 *
	 * OpenRegister's `vendor/autoload.php` is deliberately NOT required: that
	 * would pull its whole dependency tree into this process, where versions
	 * differing from ours would win first-come.
	 *
	 * Deliberately NOT `IAppManager::loadApp('openregister')`: that marks
	 * OpenRegister loaded and calls `Coordinator::bootApp()`, booting it before
	 * its own `register()` has run.
	 *
	 * Idempotent: a second call while registered is a no-op and does not stack
	 * another loader.

	 *                                              that must NEVER rethrow — is
	 *                                              reachable from a test with an id
