/**
 * TEST STUB: a verbatim copy of integriq's ExchangeGateRequestedEvent (ConductionNL/integriq#2220,
 * openspec/changes/learniq-exchange-jobs-native/contract.md). Learniq has no class dependency
 * on integriq; its unit tests construct the real contract, never a double, so a wrong getter fails.
 *
 * Integriq Exchange Gate Requested Event.
 *
 * Integriq asks the app that owns an exchange job whether the job may run,
 * and which records may leave.
